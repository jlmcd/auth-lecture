## Authentication Via `bcryptjs`

This repository contains a basic example of authentication using the package `bcryptjs`. Its purpose is to demonstrate the hashing and salting of passwords, as well as good practices in storing hash values (not plain text passwords, or even encrypted passwords) in a database via `massive`. It also utilizes `express-session` to save the user data of the logged in user.
